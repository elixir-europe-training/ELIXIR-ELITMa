## Why context matters

- A data management strategy must reflect the real situation of the Node. Each Node brings together different institutions, services and research communities. Without a basic understanding of this landscape it becomes difficult to set priorities or design a realistic plan

- A strategy also depends on people. No single person can see the whole picture. A small team with different backgrounds helps ensure that the strategy is balanced and grounded in daily practice

## What to understand

Mapping your context does not require great detail. A simple overview is enough to guide the early stages of strategy development. Useful elements include:

**Governance**: 
- Who decides on RDM topics
- Where decisions are discussed or approved

**Data landscape**:
- Research domains and data types
- Typical workflows

**Services**:
- Existing RDM services and tools
- Service owners and users

**Policies and standards**:
- Relevant guidelines and standards

**Training and support**:
- Current support for researchers
- Gaps or unmet needs

**Sustainability**:
- Staffing, funding cycles and long term plans

## How to organise the team 

Start with a small group. Two or three people can begin. The group can grow as the work develops. A useful NDMS team often includes: 
- Node coordination
- Data stewards or data managers
- Service or infrastructure leads
- Training or support staff
- Community representatives

Agree early on meeting rhythm, decision making and shared documents.

## How to start 

Begin with small steps, e.g.,: 
- **List what exists**: Note institutions, services and roles
- **Identify who is needed**: Mark essential roles now and later
- **Plan the first meeting**: Create a short agenda and shared workspace
- **Stay transparent**: Let others know the work has started

## Who to involve

Start small and expand as needed. Involve people who: 
- Understand Node structures
- Work with data or services
- Support researchers
- Can coordinate or guide planning

## Exercises 

1. **Context map**: create a table with governance, data, services, policies, training and sustainability. Add short notes to the table

2. **Team outline**: List people needed for the NDMS team. Mark essential and optional roles

3. **Stakeholder grid**: Place stakeholders in a 2 × 2 grid of influence versus interest

4. **First meeting**: Draft a brief agenda with three key questions to answer for your Node by your team

## Examples from Nodes 

- **Example 1**: Node x created a one page service map. It revealed overlaps and started helpful conversations
- **Example 2**: Node y involved its training coordinator early. This linked stewardship and researcher support
- **Example 3**: Node z began with two people. After drafting an outline they invited technical experts for focused input
