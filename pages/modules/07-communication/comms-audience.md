## Who are your stakeholders

A successful communication strategy starts with knowing your audience. In a research infrastructure like ELIXIR, your stakeholders are diverse: policymakers, funders, researchers from other disciplines, industry partners and sometimes the general public. Each group has different interests, levels of expertise and preferred ways of receiving information. For example:

* Policymakers want concise, actionable summaries that highlight societal or economic impact.
* Funders are interested in results, value for money, and long-term benefits.
* Researchers may want technical details, data access or collaboration opportunities.

Each Node will also have a different priority matrix for each of these stakeholders. Consider building a priority matrix to decide where to focus your efforts for maximum impact. 

{% include callout.html type="note" content="Your priority matrix may evolve as your Node, project, or service evolves. These are not meant to be monolithic stones, but a guiding tool that should evolve as your project does. " %}

### Example

ELIXIR-UK used the following priority matrix (A) for 2023-2024. However, since the new funding grant began in 2025, the priority matrix shifted (B) toward more national-level intervention, thanks to additional funding and capacity to support researchers and technical professionals in the UK.

### Exercise
Think of a recent project or result from your Node. Build a priority matrix for that particular case.
Now, for each group in the priority matrix, write one sentence that would catch their attention.

## Choosing the right communication channels {#choosing-the-right-communication-channels}

Not all communication channels are created equally. The best channel depends on your audience, message and resources. Some channels are quick and easy (such as social media), while others require more effort but have a lasting impact (such as policy briefs or scientific publications).

**Channel comparison table:**

| Channel               | Effort          | Impact           | Best for                                                  |
| --------------------  | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Social media**      | Low             | Medium           | Quick updates, events, opportunities, and personal touch  |
| **Newsleetter/email** | Low             | Medium           | Targetted updates, events, opportunities                  |
| **Policy brief**      | High            | High             | Policymakers, funders                                     |
| **Newsletter**        | Medium          | Medium           | A mix of internal and external stakeholders               |
| **Scientific paper**  | High            | High (long-term) | Reaching other researchers                                |
| **Website**           | Medium          | High             | All audiences (as long as the content is well structured) |


### Exercise
Imagine one of your Node members has just finished a project deliverable that will be relevant for potential new users.

There is no perfect recipe for success, but one thing is always applicable: whichever format you use.<strong> It must fit your audience in each secenario.</strong><br>
See the example below.

### Example

ELEAD (ELIXIR LEadership And Diversity mentoring programme) had to present their key achievements for the ELIXIR Annual Report, which is often read by policymakers, European Commission officials, ELIXIR’s Board, and internal leadership. The initial text contained very detailed information that was highly relevant to those organising the programme. It did a good job of listing the year's achievements and milestones within the limited word count.

However, it did not target the needs of the report’s primary audience. The coordination team needed to showcase the real impact of the consortium and the necessity of key funding for a key diversity programme in leadership development. Read the before-and-after edits when shifting the view to the primary stakeholder. They focused on making the text easy to skim and find the key information that would matter to those shaping policy and making funding decisions.

<p>ELEAD 2.0 opened in February 2025 a new call for participants with feedback from the community. The first half of 2025 focused on the preparation of the call launch, including the Guidelines of the ELEAD 2.0 programme and the Delivery of info session, completing the List of trainers and scheduled sessions, the selection of the List of mentees and mentors and the corresponding Pairing of mentees with mentors. The ELEAD SAB were briefed about the plans and their inputs were also incorporated. The 17 selected mentees and mentors participated in the initial trainings (F2F and remote), which marked the start of the second ELEAD cohort before the AHM in 2025.</p>

<p>As part of the effort to have the wider ELIXIR network benefit from ELEAD, a workshop at the AHM in 2025 collected, dissected and organised information on other women leadership initiatives in Europe, with the aim to support the creation of similar programmes at the node levels. Further, in 2025 ELEAD also conducted the Structured interviews/surveys with ELEAD pilot participants to evaluate impact. The first Diversity training for the entire ELIXIR network and remote trainings to mentees were also delivered in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidated as a leadership programme</strong><br>
ELEAD 2.0 moved beyond the pilot phase, informed by evidence, participant feedback and community input. Updated guidelines strengthened the mentoring and leadership training model, and the delivery of a second cohort confirmed ELEAD’s viability as an intervention supporting gender-balanced leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded training to the wider ELIXIR</strong><br>
ELEAD expanded its training beyond cohort participants in response to direct community demand. This embedded wellbeing, diversity, inclusion and resilience as shared infrastructure priorities rather than individual concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Demonstrated early impact through an impact report</strong><br>
ELEAD Impact Report presented early evidence of impact through four in-depth personal case studies. The report demonstrated how structured leadership training, mentoring and peer networks contributed to increased leadership confidence, strengthened cross-Node relationships, career progression and early organisational benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Became a reference model for local investment and replication</strong><br>
Nodes have utilised ELEAD as a success case when justifying local investment in leadership, mentoring and diversity initiatives. Uptake at Node level provided concrete indicators of sustainability and transferability beyond the centrally funded ELIXIR project.</p>
