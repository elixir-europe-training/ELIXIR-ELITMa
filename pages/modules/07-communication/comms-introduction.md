Effective communication is the backbone of successful research. In a distributed network like ELIXIR, it’s essential to distinguish between internal and external communication – and to excel at both. While this module focuses primarily on internal communication within ELIXIR, external communication will always go hand in hand for clarity and impact. But first, let’s define internal and external communication: 

* **Internal communication** refers to the flow of information within your Node or across the entire ELIXIR consortium. This includes team meetings, project updates and sharing best practices. For example, a monthly/weekly internal newsletter can keep all team members aligned on project milestones and upcoming deadlines. Clear internal communication helps prevent misunderstandings, ensures everyone works toward the same goals and fosters a collaborative culture.
* **External communication** is how you present your work to the outside world. This includes communicating with other researchers, policymakers, funders and the general public. Here, the focus is on clarity, accessibility and impact. For instance, when preparing a report for policymakers, avoid technical jargon and instead highlight the societal benefits of your research and initiatives.

Let’s consider this potential scenario:

During a multi-Node project, a lack of regular updates led to duplicated efforts and confusion about responsibilities. The Work Package leads went in the same direction as another one without realising that they both produced the same output.

**Considering communication strategies before a project begins is the first step towards avoiding duplicated efforts and team misalignment. Considering which outputs will be relevant to people outside the project will also position your work as a success for future funding avenues for your Node and the consortium at large. **


## Examples

* How did a Node communicate an opportunity that reached the entire consortium – BioHackathon Germany comms?
* How a deliverable was turned into an impact/outreach story – TBC


## Quick exercise

Reflect on your own Node’s communication practices. Use the following five-question audit to identify areas for improvement:

[ ] Do all active members know where to find the latest project updates?
[ ] Have I identified opportunities for the consortium and important deliverables to be communicated?
[ ] Is there a straightforward process for sharing successes/deliverables and lessons learned?
[ ] Are our members aware of our current projects and objectives?
[ ] Are the channels that I use working for both internal and external communications?


## Existing resources

Communicating research and, in particular, inside Research Infrastructures, is complex, but the end communications piece should not reflect that complexity. This short module will help you understand how to take action on some of the easy steps and give you cues for ELIXIR-specific applications. 

If you want to delve deeper, there are numerous resources you can use to communicate more clearly. Here are a few key ones to highlight:
* [Communication Toolkit for Research Infrastructures](https://ri-vis.eu/network/rivis/news/launch-of-communication-toolkit-for-research-infrastructures/)
* [Communication Toolkit for European Projects](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/communication-toolkit_en)
