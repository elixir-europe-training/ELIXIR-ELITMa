**Chapter 2.2 Understanding your Node context and organising your NDMS team**
**Objective**: Understand the environment in which your Node operates and organise the team that will guide the development of your data management strategy

## Why context matters

- A data management strategy must reflect the real situation of the Node. Each Node brings together different institutions, services and research communities. Without a basic understanding of this landscape it becomes difficult to set priorities or design a realistic plan

- A strategy also depends on people. No single person can see the whole picture. A small team with different backgrounds helps ensure that the strategy is balanced and grounded in daily practice

## What to understand

Mapping your context does not require great detail. A simple overview is enough to guide the early stages of strategy development. Useful elements include:

**Governance**: 
- Who decides on RDM topics
- Where decisions are discussed or approved

**Data landscape**:
- Research domains and data types
- Typical workflows

**Services**:
- Existing RDM services and tools
- Service owners and users

**Policies and standards**:
- Relevant guidelines and standards

**Training and support**:
- Current support for researchers
- Gaps or unmet needs

**Sustainability**:
- Staffing, funding cycles and long term plans
