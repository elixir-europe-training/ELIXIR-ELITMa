**Chapter 2.1 Why your node needs a Node data management strategy (NDMS)**
**Objective**: Build a shared understanding of why a NDMS matters and what it offers to your Node

## Why a NDMS matters

- ELIXIR Nodes bring together many institutions, services and communities. Each group works with data in different ways. Without a shared direction it becomes difficult to coordinate work or explain how the Node supports its researchers. A NDMS helps create this direction and provides clarity
  
- It shows what the Node wants to achieve in data management, how its services fit together and where support is still needed. It reduces duplication, improves communication and helps staff understand their roles
  
- A strategy also supports long-term planning. It helps the Node decide which services to maintain, where to invest effort and how to respond to new demands or opportunities. Funders and national partners often expect this kind of clarity. A NDMS offers a simple way to meet that expectation

## What a NDMS is

- A NDMS is a short, practical document. It outlines the main goals of the Node, the data landscape it serves and the principles that guide its work

- It brings together information that often exists in many places. It does not replace detailed policies, service descriptions or Data Management Plans. Instead, it connects them

- A NDMS shows how the Node supports good data management and FAIR practices. It describes the main services, roles and communities involved

- It also gives staff a shared view of the current situation and future direction

- The strategy should be light and easy to update. It evolves as the Node grows, new roles appear or priorities shift. It is a living reference document, not a fixed plan

## A NDMS in practice 

- A strategy works by giving people a common reference point. When staff use the same goals and priorities, it becomes easier to make decisions, plan activities and coordinate across institutions

- It also helps with budget planning and acquiring funding. A clear strategy shows which topics matter most and where resources are needed. This supports leadership and teams when planning budgets or seeking support

- A NDMS links existing work. Nodes often have policies, maturity assessments, training plans and service descriptions. The strategy brings these together. It helps show how each element contributes to the wider picture

## Developing a NDMS

Starting does not require a full plan. Three simple steps help teams move from discussion to action. Later chapters will guide the process in more detail

**1. Begin with what already exists**: Collect documents, notes or agreements related to data or services. These offer a starting point

**2. Form a small working group**: Two or three people can begin. The group can grow as needed, but an initial core keeps the work focused

**3. Draft a short outline**: A one-page outline helps create a shared view of the scope. It can change as the group learns more

## Who to involve 

A strategy needs input from several perspectives. Together, these roles create a realistic and balanced view of the Node. No single person can capture all parts of the data landscape. A small but diverse team makes the work stronger

- **Node coordinators** help set direction and ensure alignment with national and ELIXIR priorities
  
- **Data stewards** and **technical staff** bring knowledge of daily practice, standards, tools and workflows
  
- **Support** and **training staff** understand user needs and help ensure researchers receive consistent guidance
  
- **Community representatives** ensure that the strategy reflects the needs of the researchers the Node serves

## Exercises 

**1. Three reasons**: List three reasons why your Node would benefit from a NDMS. Share with a partner 

**2. Risks without a strategy**: Write down three risks that could occur if your Node continues without a NDMS

**3. What exists already**: Identify documents or practices that may feed into a NDMS. Mark which ones are most useful

## Examples from Nodes

**Example 1**: Node x created a brief NDMS to clarify who owns which services. This helped new staff settle in quickly

**Example 2**: Node y used its NDMS to decide which tools to maintain and which partnerships to strengthen

**Example 3**: Node z drafted a simple two page NDMS during a retreat. It became a helpful reference during funding discussions
