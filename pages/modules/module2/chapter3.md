**Chapter 2.3 What to include in a Node data management strategy (NDMS)**

**Objective**: Identify the essential elements that belong in a NDMS and understand how to choose what matters most for your Node

## Why these elements matter

A NDMS works best when it covers the right topics. It does not need to be long, but it should offer a clear picture of what your Node wants to achieve and how it supports researchers. A simple structure helps you set priorities, avoid blind spots and connect existing work. This chapter introduces two useful frames. The first helps you think about your aims. The second helps you decide which themes and topics your NDMS should address. Together they offer a practical guide for shaping the content of your strategy.

## What the strategy should cover

### A thinking frame: Goals, Objectives, Resources and Constraints

This first frame helps you clarify the purpose and direction of your NDMS. It helps the team stay focused and realistic. You can return to it as you refine your NDMS.
- **Goals**: Long term ambitions. What your Node wants to improve or strengthen in research data management
- **Objectives**: short term, concrete results. What you want to achieve in the next one to two years.
- **Resources**: People, skills, services, infrastructure and funding needed to make progress.
- **Constraints**: Limitations and dependencies such as staffing, funding cycles, fragmented structures or external policies.

### A content frame: Elements from the Global Open Research Commons

The second frame draws on the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Global Open Research Commons (GORC) model (read the [article](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2024-056). It highlights the typical components of a research data ecosystem. These elements help you decide what to include in your NDMS and where you may need more clarity.

- **Governance**: How decisions are made and how responsibilities are shared.
- **Policies and legal frameworks**: Institutional or national requirements and guidelines.
- **Services and infrastructure**: Data services, tools and technical components available in the Node.
- **Data and metadata**: The kinds of data your Node supports and the information needed to describe them.
- **Standards and interoperability**: Disciplinary standards and practices that support FAIR data.
- **Training and capacity building**: How users learn about data management and receive support.
- **Community engagement**: How the Node interacts with its research communities.
- **Sustainability and funding**: How services, skills and activities are maintained over time.

You do not need to address each topic in equal depth. The list is a guide to help you decide what is relevant for your Node.
