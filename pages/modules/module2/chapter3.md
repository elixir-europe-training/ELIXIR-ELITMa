**Chapter 2.3 What to include in a Node data management strategy (NDMS)**

**Objective**: Identify the essential elements that belong in a NDMS and understand how to choose what matters most for your Node

## Why these elements matter

A NDMS works best when it covers the right topics. It does not need to be long, but it should offer a clear picture of what your Node wants to achieve and how it supports researchers. A simple structure helps you set priorities, avoid blind spots and connect existing work. This chapter introduces two useful frames. The first helps you think about your aims. The second helps you decide which themes and topics your NDMS should address. Together they offer a practical guide for shaping the content of your strategy.

## What the strategy should cover

### A thinking frame: Goals, Objectives, Resources and Constraints

This first frame helps you clarify the purpose and direction of your NDMS. It helps the team stay focused and realistic. You can return to it as you refine your NDMS.
- **Goals**: Long term ambitions. What your Node wants to improve or strengthen in research data management
- **Objectives**: short term, concrete results. What you want to achieve in the next one to two years.
- **Resources**: People, skills, services, infrastructure and funding needed to make progress.
- **Constraints**: Limitations and dependencies such as staffing, funding cycles, fragmented structures or external policies.

### A content frame: Elements from the Global Open Research Commons

The second frame draws on the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Global Open Research Commons (GORC) model (read the [article](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2024-056)). It highlights the typical components of a research data ecosystem. These elements help you decide what to include in your NDMS and where you may need more clarity.

- **Governance**: How decisions are made and how responsibilities are shared.
- **Policies and legal frameworks**: Institutional or national requirements and guidelines.
- **Services and infrastructure**: Data services, tools and technical components available in the Node.
- **Data and metadata**: The kinds of data your Node supports and the information needed to describe them.
- **Standards and interoperability**: Disciplinary standards and practices that support FAIR data.
- **Training and capacity building**: How users learn about data management and receive support.
- **Community engagement**: How the Node interacts with its research communities.
- **Sustainability and funding**: How services, skills and activities are maintained over time.

You do not need to address each topic in equal depth. The list is a guide to help you decide what is relevant for your Node.

## How to choose what matters 

Priorities depend on your context. Start by identifying areas where the Node already has clarity and areas where work is needed. Your strategy should highlight the topics that matter most now, not everything that could be included. Your NDMS may begin with a small set of topics. It can grow as your Node’s needs evolve.

Useful questions include: 
- Which goals are most important for the next two years?
- Which services or communities require attention?
- Which gaps limit daily work?
- Which constraints need to be addressed or acknowledged?
- Which activities will have the most impact with limited resources

## Who to involve at this stage 

Different elements require different kinds of expertise. Involve: 
- data stewards and service leads for technical elements
- community representatives for domain specific standards
- coordinators or managers for governance and planning
- training or support staff for skills and outreach
- policy or legal experts when relevant

Not all of these people need to join every discussion. Invite them when their input is needed.

## Exercises

**1. Goals and objectives**: Write one long term goal for your NDMS and two short term objectives

**2. Priority topics**: Select three GORC elements that matter most for your Node today. Add one sentence explaining why

**3. Resource and constraint scan**: List the main resources your Node can rely on and the constraints that may limit progress

**4. Simple NDMS outline**: Draft a one page outline for your strategy using any of the elements above

## Examples from Nodes

**Example 1**: Node x focused its NDMS on two main topics: clarity of roles and better support for data standards. This kept the strategy manageable

**Example 2**: Another Node used the GORC elements to review existing services. This revealed that training and community engagement needed more attention

**Example 3**: A Node with limited staff chose to focus on objectives that could be achieved within existing resources. The strategy was short but effective
